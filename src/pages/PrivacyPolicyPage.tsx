            <p>
              We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal data from unauthorised access, use or disclosure. For example, we store the personal data you provide on computer systems that have limited access and are in controlled facilities.

              We retain personal data for as long as necessary to provide the services and feedback you have requested, or for other essential purposes such as complying with our legal obligations or enforcing our agreements. Because these needs can vary for different types of data, the actual retention periods may vary. In determining retention periods we consider:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
              <li>Whether the personal data is of a sensitive type — in such cases a shortened retention time (e.g., up to five years) might apply.</li>
              <li>Whether Oscillion Software is subject to a legal, contractual or similar obligation to retain the data (for example, a legal requirement or a court order).</li>
